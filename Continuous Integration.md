# What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous integration (CI) was created for agile development.It organizes development into functional user stories. These user stories are put into smaller groups of work, sprints. The idea of continuous integration is to find issues quickly, giving each developer feedback on their work and test-driven development (TDD) evaluates that work quickly.
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

# Advantages of CI
* Avoids last-minute chaos at release dates, when everyone tries to check in their slightly incompatible versions
* Committing code frequently
* When unit tests fail or a bug emerges, if developers need to revert the codebase to a bug-free state without debugging, only a small number of changes are lost (because integration happens frequently)
* Immediate feedback on system-wide impact of local changes
* Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly

# Conclusion 
CI is a standard mixture of modern high efficiency software development organizations. The best companies have robust CI pipelines and donâ€™t think twice about further efficiency investments. The benefits of CI are not limited to the engineering team and applicable to the whole organization.
