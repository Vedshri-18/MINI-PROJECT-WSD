# Repository
A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.
You can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing the repository's visibility. For user-owned repositories, you can give other people collaborator access so that they can collaborate on your project. If a repository is owned by an organization, you can give organization members access permissions to collaborate on your repository. 
With GitHub Free for user accounts and organizations, you can work with unlimited collaborators on unlimited public repositories with a full feature set, or unlimited private repositories with a limited feature set. To get advanced tooling for private repositories, you can upgrade to GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
