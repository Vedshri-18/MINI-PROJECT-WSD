Fork.md
##Fork
Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit Pull Requests to help make other peopleâ€™s projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Propose changes to someone else's project
For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the fix.
3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.
