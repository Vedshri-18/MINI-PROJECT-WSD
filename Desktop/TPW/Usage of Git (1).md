# Why do we use Git? 
* Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.
* Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
* So Git does not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every user “clones” a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This clone has all of the metadata of the original while the original itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting service like GitHub.
* Git helps you keep track of the changes you make to your code. It is basically the history tab for your code editor(With no incognito mode.

* In the example above, all three cards represent different versions of the same file. We can select which version of the file we want to use at any point of time. So I can jump to and fro to any version of the file in the git time continuum. 
* Git also helps you synchronise code between multiple people. So imagine you and your friend are collaborating on a project. You both are working on the same project files. Now Git takes those changes you and your friend made independently and merges them to a single “Master” repository. So by using Git you can ensure you both are working on the most recent version of the repository.
