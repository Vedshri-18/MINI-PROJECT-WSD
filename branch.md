## branch
Branch in Git is similar to the branch of a tree. Analogically, a tree branch is attached to the central part of the tree called the trunk. While branches can generate and fall off, the trunk remains compact and is the only part by which we can say the tree is alive and standing. Similarly, a branch in Git is a way to keep developing and coding a new feature or modification to the software and still not affecting the main part of the project. We can also say that branches create another line of development in the project. The primary or default branch in Git is the master branch (similar to a trunk of the tree). As soon as the repository creates, so does the main branch (or the default branch).


Branches give you the freedom to independently work on different modules (not necessarily though) and merge the modules when you finish developing them. It might sound a cumbersome process, but git branches are swift to be created and destroyed. Just a simple command can perform these processes, and they are very cheap, considering the size they take. Branches in Git help the team, which are in different parts of the world, work independently on independent features that would ultimately combine to produce a great project. Moreover, the branches are very flexible. Using branches does not mean you are using them for different features

## Different operations of Branch
1. Create a Branch: This is the first step in the process, you can start on a default branch or create a new branch for the development.
2. Merge A Branch: An already running branch can merge with any other branch in your Git repository. Merging a branch can help when you are done with the branch and want the code to integrate into another branch code.
3. Delete A Branch: An already running branch can delete from your Git repository. Deleting a branch can help when the branch has done its job, i.e., it’s already merged, or you no longer need it in your repository for any reason.
4. Checkout A Branch: An already running branch can pull or checkout to make a clone of the branch so that the user can work on any of them. Pulling a branch can help when you don’t want to disturb the older branch and experiment on the new one.
