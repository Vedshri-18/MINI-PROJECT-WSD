## Clone
Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy of the remote repo. This allows you to make all of your edits locally rather than directly in the source files of the origin repo.
When we clone a repository, all the files are downloaded to the local machine but the remote git repository remains unchanged. Making changes and committing them on your local repository (cloned repository) will not affect the remote repository that you cloned in any way. These changes made on the local machine can be synced with the remote repository anytime the user wants.

## Why Clone a repository
The real reason why cloning is reqired are:
Contribute to Organizational Projects:  A centralized system is required for organizations where multiple people work on the same code base. Cloning helps us achieve this motive. By cloning, people can edit the project code to either fix some issue or provide some modifications i.e. an extra or extended feature. This definitely helps in producing better software in less time with greater collaboration.
Make use of Open-Source Repositories: A famous idiom in English, “Do not reinvent the wheel” is suitable for this point to understand it. Similarly, if someone wants to use some functionality which has already been developed by someone else, then why to code it from scratch and waste time & resources? For e.g, there are unlimited opensource repositories are available, which can directly fit into the projects.

## How does cloning works in Git?
A lot of people want to set up a shared repository to allow a team of developers to publish their code on GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket etc. A repository which is uploaded online for collaboration is called an Upstream Repository or a Central Repository.

A central repository indicates that all the changes from all the contributors pushed into this repository only. So, this is the most updated repository instance of itself. Sometimes this is often called as the original repository.
